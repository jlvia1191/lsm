Description: When the values of the outcome variable Y are either 0 or 1, the function lsm calculates the estimation of the log likelihood in the saturated model. This model is characterized by Llinas [1] in section 2.3 through the assumptions 1 and 2. The function "LogLik" works (almost perfectly) when the mumber of independent variables K is high, but for small K it calculates wrong values. For this reason, when Y is dichotomous and the data are grouped or ungrouped, it is recommended the function lsm because it works very well for all K.
